# Travel Planner with LangChain & Streamlit

Welcome to the Travel Planner project! This project utilizes **LangChain**'s powerful tools like `ChatPromptTemplate`, `ChatModel`, and `OutputParser` to create an intelligent travel planner. The user interface is built using **Streamlit**, making it easy to interact with and plan travel destinations.

## Project Overview

The Travel Planner app helps users generate customized travel itineraries by interacting with a conversational AI. Users can input preferences (e.g., travel destination, type of vacation) and receive personalized travel suggestions. The application processes the user inputs and generates tailored recommendations, leveraging LangChain's language models to provide accurate and relevant responses.

## Features

- **Personalized Travel Recommendations**: The app uses LangChain’s chat-based models to suggest travel destinations based on user inputs.
- **Interactive UI**: The app is built with **Streamlit**, which provides a simple, user-friendly interface for users to interact with.
- **Dynamic Itinerary Creation**: Based on user queries, the app can generate itineraries and offer suggestions for different types of vacations (beach, cultural, adventure, etc.).
- **Output Parsing**: The model’s outputs are parsed and formatted for easy understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: A framework for building LLM-powered applications with components like `ChatPromptTemplate`, `ChatModel`, and `OutputParser`.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library that simplifies the creation of web apps for data science and machine learning projects, used for the user interface.
- **Python**: The core language used for implementing the logic and API interactions.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for generating travel-related responses based on user queries.
